# FreeCallApp


Creating a flash card alternative app similar to applications like Anki, Duolingo, Memorize etc
The idea of this application is that you aren't using qued recall instead you use Free Recall.
When studying languages, medicine, law or other concept based material Free Recall will allow better retention of material and a deeper understanding. The idea of this applications scope is more limited then other flashcard tools although this may change as the application evolves.
